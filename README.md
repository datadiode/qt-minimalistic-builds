# qt-minimalistic-builds

Based on unmodified source code of Qt.  
The license of produced Qt binaries is the same as applies to original OSS Qt libraries.  
The build phase of these prebuilt binaries is reproducible through the AppVeyor build script.  
Target Qt versions of this project are limited to 6.2.0 through 6.4.3.  
What you get as compared to the original distro is an OpenSSL backend which works with OpenSSL 3.
